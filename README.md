# R-code for my master's thesis
This repository contains the R-code that I used for the analyses in my master's thesis: "Differential analysis of single-cell proteomics data: going beyond the comparison of means".

The different scripts should be runned as follows.
- Preprocessing: <br />
&emsp; 1. [Minimal preprocessing](minimal_preprocessing.Rmd) <br />
&emsp; 2. [Further preprocessing](preprocessing_continued.Rmd) <br />
- Data simulation: <br />
&emsp; 3. [Creating mock datasets](create_mock_datasets.Rmd) <br />
- Data exploration: <br />
&emsp; 4. [Dimensionality reduction](dimensionality_reduction.Rmd) <br />
- Modelling with MSqRob: <br />
&emsp; 5. [msqrob2 models](msqrob2_models.Rmd) <br />
- Density estimation: <br />
&emsp; 6. [Density of combined groups](density_estimation_combined_groups.Rmd) <br />
&emsp; 7. [Density of multiple groups](density_estimation_multiple_groups.Rmd) <br />
- Comparison between results from MSqRob and density estimation: <br />
&emsp; 8. [Results and model comparisons](results_and_model_comparisons.Rmd) <br />
