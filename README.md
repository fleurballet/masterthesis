# R-code for my master's thesis
This repository contains the R-code that I used for the analyses in my master's thesis: "Differential analysis of single-cell proteomics data: going beyond the comparison of means".

The different scripts should be runned as follows.
- Preprocessing:
  1. [Minimal preprocessing](minimal_preprocessing.Rmd)
  2. [Further preprocessing](preprocessing_continued.Rmd)
- Data simulation:
  3. [Creating mock datasets](create_mock_datasets.Rmd)
- Data exploration:
  4. [Dimensionality reduction](dimensionality_reduction.Rmd)
- Modelling with MSqRob:
  5. [msqrob2 models](msqrob2_models.Rmd)
- Density estimation:
  6. [Density of combined groups](density_estimation_combined_groups.Rmd)
  7. [Density of multiple groups](density_estimation_multiple_groups.Rmd)
- Comparison between results from MSqRob and density estimation:
  8. [Results and model comparisons](results_and_model_comparisons.Rmd)
